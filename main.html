	<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity.</h1>
	<p> Time complexity is a measure used in computer science to analyze and describe the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the time it takes to execute as a function of the input size. It is a crucial concept when evaluating the performance of algorithms and helps us understand how the execution time of an algorithm scales with the size of the input Efficient algorithms are characterized by lower time complexity, meaning they can handle larger inputs in a reasonable amount of time. Algorithms with lower time complexity are considered more scalable and practical for solving problems efficiently.</p>
	<p><b>Space complexity </b>refers to the amount of memory space an algorithm or program requires to complete its execution. the space complexity would be 
O(n) because the space required is directly proportional to the input size.</p>
